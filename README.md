# CS279r HW: Todo App in Flask

This code creates a basic to-do list web app using Flask. In addition to the basic functionality of adding and checking off todos, it also allows users to delete todos entirely and displays a counter of the number of incomplete todos. 

## Usage

Clone this repository (from the command line or using GitHub Desktop). If from the command line, use the following command:

git clone https://github.com/19katz/flask-todo-app.git

Once cloned locally, open up the to-do app by running the following commands (only run the first if Flask is not yet installed):

* `pip install Flask`
* `python3 app.py`

Then, navigate to the localhost link given on the terminal console. Ensure that Flask is installed before going to the link, or it will not work.
